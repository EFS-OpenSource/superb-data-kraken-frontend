# How does it work?

SDK is divided into different components that can be combined according to your preferences. It all starts with data upload.  
In this process, data is processed through a secure area and transferred to the desired storage location.

During the upload, metadata is captured and processed in a search engine. If needed, this data can be made fully searchable based on content.  
Automated analysis takes place through workflows, which can be generated and customized as per requirements and preferences.

The results are then stored in appropriate databases and visualized through interactive dashboards. Users can access the data and the insights  
derived from it. Of course, access permissions can be managed and personalized by the admin at any time.

The goal is to generate knowledge from corporate data using custom processing pipelines. Make company decisions based on facts and lead your
