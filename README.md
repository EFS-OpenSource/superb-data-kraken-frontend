# Prerequisites

This is a starter repo for a standalone Nx React application. Good luck!

First of all, run
```
npm install
```

or the installation with your favourite package manager, to install the dependencies!

After installing the dependecies some files might show an error that they can not find the types. Simply restarting VS Code (or the IDE of your choice) should fix that.

# Nx Generators

NOTE: If you have npx installed globally, you can skip the "npx" at the beginning of the command
<br>

To generate a component use (the --directory flag is optional, but most likely you want to place the new component in a certain folder):

```
npx nx g @nx/react:component NewComponentName --directory=components
```

Or the shorter version:

```
npx nx g c NewComponentName --directory=components
```

Story

```
npx nx g component-story
```

This will generate a folder with the given name and inside that folder will generate the NewComponentName.tsx component and a .spec.tsx test file with a simple render test.
We omit the auto-generation of a style file (.scss in this project) as we mostly use bootstrap classes and don't want to clutter the folders unnecessarily.
